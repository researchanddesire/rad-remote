This guide covers the 3D printed parts required to build a RADR wireless remote.

## Required Parts

| Part | Quantity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Top Housing | 1 | Main body with display cutout |
| Bottom Housing | 1 | Battery compartment and mounting |
| Buttons | 3 | Under-screen buttons |
| Encoder Knobs | 2 | Left and right encoder caps |
| Power Switch Cap | 1 | Optional cover for power switch |

## Print Settings

These parts print nicely with the following settings:

| Parameter | Recommended Value |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Layer Height | 0.12mm (for smooth curves) |
| Wall Thickness | 4 layers |
| Infill | 20-30% |
| Material | PLA, PETG, or ASA |

<Tip>
Using your slicer's auto layer height function will balance resolution and speed.
</Tip>

### Top Housing

The top housing requires significant supports due to the display cutout and internal features.

- Print with the display opening facing up
- Enable supports for overhangs
- For Bambu printers, the included 3mf file has recommended support settings

### Remote Clip (Optional)

If you're printing the wireless remote clip for mounting:

| Parameter | Recommended Value |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Wall Thickness | 6 layers |
| Infill | 40%+ |

The clip needs extra strength to handle repeated mounting and removal.

## Multi-Color Printing

Many of these parts contain multiple bodies to allow multi-color printing. This is optional—you can print all as the same color if you don't need to see the LEDs through the housing.

### Transparent Sections

The following areas benefit from transparent or translucent filament:

| Area | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Power indicator | Shows charging LED |
| Button status indicators | Shows button backlighting |
| Knob backlight areas | Shows encoder LED colors |

<Info>
Multi-color printing is purely aesthetic. The device functions identically with single-color prints.

### Available Formats

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| .3mf | Bambu Studio project with print settings |
| .step | Editable CAD format for modifications |
| .stl | Standard mesh format for any slicer |

## Assembly Tips

<Tip>
Test fit all parts before final assembly. Some printer calibration variation may require light sanding.
</Tip>

<Tip>
The encoder knobs press-fit onto the encoder shafts. Apply even pressure when installing.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Don't over-tighten screws into 3D printed parts. The threads can strip if overtightened.
</Warning>
