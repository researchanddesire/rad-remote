## Assembly Notes

<Steps>
<Step title="Check fit">
  Test fit the PCB and battery before final assembly. Verify the USB-C port aligns with the housing opening.
  
  <Check>
  The PCB sits flat on the mounting bosses with no interference.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify clearances">
  Ensure the battery fits with adequate clearance. Some printer tolerances may require light sanding.
  
  <Warning>
  Do not force components. If fit is too tight, sand lightly rather than applying excessive force.
  </Warning>
</Step>
