## Function

The Power Switch Cap is an optional decorative cover that fits over the power switch toggle. This component:

- Provides an aesthetically finished look to the power switch
- Sits over the existing switch toggle
- Purely cosmetic—not required for operation

<Tip>
This is a very small part. Print multiple copies or include it with other small parts like the buttons for efficiency.
</Tip>

## Installation

<Steps>
<Step title="Print the cap">
  Print the power switch cap using the settings above.

  <Check>
  The cap is free of defects and has clean surfaces.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Press onto switch">
  Gently press the cap onto the power switch toggle. It should friction-fit in place.

  <Warning>
  Do not use adhesive unless the fit is too loose. A drop of CA glue can be used as a last resort.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Test operation">
  Verify the switch still operates smoothly with the cap installed.

  <Check>
  Switch toggles on/off with no binding or interference.
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
This part is optional. The remote functions perfectly without it—the power switch is fully usable as-is.
