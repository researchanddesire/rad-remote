## Function

The OSSM Remote Clip allows you to mount the RADR wireless remote directly onto an OSSM aluminum extrusion frame. This component:

- Clips onto standard 2020/2040 aluminum extrusion profiles
- Provides a secure, removable mount for the remote
- Features a bottom-release mechanism for easy attachment/detachment
- Requires an M6x12 bolt for the clamping mechanism

## Print Settings

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Layer Height | 0.16mm |
| Walls | 6 |
| Infill Type | Gyroid or Grid |
| Infill Percentage | 40%+ |
| Supports | Yes - Auto |

<Warning>
This part needs extra strength to handle repeated mounting and removal. Use more walls and higher infill than other parts.
</Warning>

<Tip>
PETG or ABS is recommended over PLA for better durability and fatigue resistance.
</Tip>

## Hardware Required

| Item | Quantity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| M6x12mm bolt | 1 | Socket head or button head |
| M6 nut (optional) | 1 | Depending on clip design variant |

## Installation

<Steps>
<Step title="Print the clip">
  Print with increased wall count and infill for durability.

  <Check>
  The clip is solid with no visible layer separation or weak spots.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Insert hardware">
  Thread the M6x12 bolt into the clip's clamping mechanism.

  <Tip>
  If threads are tight, run the bolt in and out a few times to clean them, or chase with an M6 tap.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Mount to extrusion">
  Position the clip on the aluminum extrusion and tighten the bolt to clamp it in place.

  <Warning>
  Don't overtighten—the plastic can crack. Tighten until secure, then stop.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Attach remote">
  Slide or clip the RADR remote into the mounted clip.

  <Check>
  Remote is secure and doesn't wobble or fall out during use.
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Clip doesn't fit extrusion snugly">
- Check that you're using standard 2020 or 2040 aluminum extrusion.
- Some printer tolerances may require scaling the model by ±1%.
- Lightly sand the inside surfaces for a better fit.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Clip cracks when tightening">
- Reduce clamping force.
- Reprint with more walls (8+) and higher infill (50%+).
- Use PETG or ABS instead of PLA.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Bolt threads strip">
- Use a metal M6 nut embedded in the clip (heat-set insert or press-fit).
- Chase threads with an M6 tap before use.
- Print with finer layer height for better thread definition.
