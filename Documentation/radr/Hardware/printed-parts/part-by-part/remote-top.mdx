## Function

The Top Housing is the main upper shell of the RADR wireless remote. This component:

- Houses the TFT display with a precision cutout for the screen
- Provides openings for the three tactile buttons
- Features mounting points for the rotary encoders (knobs)
- Contains windows for LED status indicators (optional transparent sections)
- Defines the primary ergonomic grip surface

## Print Settings

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Layer Height | 0.12mm (for smooth curves) |
| Walls | 4 |
| Infill Type | Gyroid |
| Infill Percentage | 20-30% |
| Supports | Yes - significant supports needed |

<Note>
The display cutout and internal features require substantial support material. For Bambu printers, the included 3MF file has optimized support settings.
</Note>

<Tip>
Print with the display opening facing up for best results on the visible surfaces.
</Tip>

## Multi-Color Printing (Optional)

The top housing includes separate bodies for multi-color printing:

| Area | Purpose | Recommended Material |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| Power indicator window | Shows charging LED | Transparent/translucent |
| Button status windows | Shows button backlighting | Transparent/translucent |
| Knob backlight rings | Shows encoder LED colors | Transparent/translucent |

<Info>
Multi-color printing is purely aesthetic. The remote functions identically with single-color prints.
