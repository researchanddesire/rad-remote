## Function

The Encoder Knobs are press-fit caps for the RADR wireless remote's rotary encoders. This component:

- Provides an ergonomic grip surface for encoder control
- Press-fits onto the encoder shafts
- Features optional translucent sections for LED backlighting
- Two knobs required per remote (left and right encoders)

## Print Settings

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Layer Height | 0.12mm |
| Walls | 4 |
| Infill Type | Gyroid |
| Infill Percentage | 25% |
| Supports | Yes - Auto |

<Tip>
Print with the shaft cavity facing upward for best surface quality inside the bore.
</Tip>

## Multi-Color Printing (Optional)

The knobs include a separate body for the backlight ring area:

| Area | Purpose | Recommended Material |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| Backlight ring | Shows encoder LED colors | Transparent/translucent |
| Main body | Grip surface | Any opaque color |

## Installation

<Steps>
<Step title="Prepare the part">
  Remove supports and lightly deburr the bore with a hobby knife or small round file.

  <Check>
  The bore is clean and smooth; no support material remains inside.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Test fit on the encoder shaft">
  Align the knob with the encoder shaft. Do not force it—ensure alignment first.

  <Warning>
  Excessive force can damage the encoder. Apply steady, straight pressure only.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Press-fit the knob">
  Press straight down until fully seated. Repeat for the second encoder.

  <Check>
  Knobs rotate smoothly and the remote registers encoder turns and clicks.
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Fit is too tight">
- Lightly ream the bore with a small round file or deburring tool.
- Re-slice with −0.5% to −1% XY scale or use a negative horizontal expansion value.
- Warm the knob slightly (hair dryer) and press-fit while warm.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Fit is too loose">
- Re-slice with +0.5% to +1% XY scale.
- Add a thin wrap of PTFE/plumber's tape to the shaft as a temporary shim.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Support marks inside the bore">
- Increase support Z-distance/interface layers.
- Switch to tree supports or reduce support density.
- Orient with the bore up to minimize internal supports.
