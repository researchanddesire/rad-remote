## Function

The Buttons are small caps that sit over the tactile switches beneath the display. This component:

- Provides a comfortable press surface for the three under-screen buttons
- Transfers actuation force to the underlying tactile switches
- Features optional translucent sections for LED status indicators
- Three buttons required per remote

## Print Settings

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Layer Height | 0.12mm |
| Walls | 4 |
| Infill Type | Gyroid |
| Infill Percentage | 30% |
| Supports | Minimal or none |

<Tip>
These are small parts. Use a brim for bed adhesion if needed, and print multiple at once for efficiency.
</Tip>

## Multi-Color Printing (Optional)

The buttons include a separate body for the LED indicator area:

| Area | Purpose | Recommended Material |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| Indicator window | Shows button status LED | Transparent/translucent |
| Button face | Press surface | Any opaque color |

<Info>
Multi-color printing is optional. Single-color buttons work perfectly—you just won't see the status LEDs through the button caps.

</Step>

<Step title="Verify actuation">
  With the PCB installed, press each button to confirm it properly actuates the underlying switch.
