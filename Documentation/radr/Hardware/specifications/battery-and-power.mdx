This guide covers RADR's battery system, charging, and power management features.

## Battery System

RADR uses a lithium battery with intelligent monitoring:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Battery Type | Lithium Polymer (LiPo) |
| Fuel Gauge IC | MAX17048 |
| Charging Port | USB-C |
| Charging Indicator | Hardware LED |

### MAX17048 Fuel Gauge

The MAX17048 is a precision fuel gauge that provides:

- **Battery Percentage** — Accurate state-of-charge reading (0–100%)
- **Battery Voltage** — Real-time voltage measurement
- **Low Battery Alerts** — Programmable threshold notifications

<Info>
The fuel gauge uses proprietary algorithms to accurately estimate remaining battery life, compensating for factors like temperature and discharge rate.
</Info>

## Battery Indicator

The battery status is displayed in the status bar at the top of the screen:

| Level | Approximate Range |
|-------|-------------------|
| Full | 90–100% |
| High | 60–89% |
| Medium | 30–59% |
| Low | 10–29% |
| Critical | 0–9% |

<Warning>
When battery reaches critical levels, save your session and charge RADR to avoid unexpected shutdown.
</Warning>

## Charging

### USB-C Charging

RADR charges via the USB-C port located at the top of the device, next to the power switch.

- Connect any standard USB-C cable
- Compatible with USB chargers, power banks, and computer USB ports
- Charging works while RADR is powered on or off

### Charging Indicator

A hardware LED indicates charging status:

| LED State | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| LED On | Charging in progress |
| LED Off | Fully charged or not connected |

<Note>
The charging LED is separate from RADR's software-controlled RGB LEDs. It's controlled directly by the charging circuit.
</Note>

<Note>
RADR relies on the hardware charging LED rather than software-based charging detection. This provides more accurate and reliable charging status indication.
</Note>

### Charging Tips

<Tip>
For fastest charging, use a USB charger rated for 5V/1A or higher.
</Tip>

<Tip>
You can use RADR while charging, but charging may take longer during active use.
</Tip>

## Power States

RADR has several power states:

### Active (Connected)

- Display on, backlight active
- Bluetooth connected to a device
- LEDs active
- Highest power consumption

### Active (Idle)

- Display on, backlight active
- Bluetooth scanning or in menu
- LEDs in idle pattern
- Medium power consumption

### Sleep Mode

- Display off, backlight off
- Bluetooth disabled
- LEDs off
- Very low power consumption
- GPIO wake enabled

### Power Off

- All systems off
- No power consumption
- Requires power switch to wake

## Deep Sleep Mode

Deep sleep provides significant power savings when you're not using RADR but want quick access later.

<Info>
Technically, RADR uses "light sleep" mode internally rather than true deep sleep. This provides more reliable button wake-up while still achieving very low power consumption. The user experience is the same—the device appears off until a button is pressed.
</Info>

### Entering Sleep Mode

1. From the main menu, select **Sleep**
2. RADR performs the shutdown sequence:
   - Disconnects any connected devices
   - Plays the shutdown buzzer sound
   - Turns off the display backlight
   - Clears all LEDs
   - Enters deep sleep

### Wake Sources

The following buttons can wake RADR from deep sleep:

| Button | GPIO |
|--------|------|
| Under-Screen Center | GPIO 39 |
| Under-Screen Left | GPIO 38 |
| Under-Screen Right | GPIO 40 |

Press any of these buttons to wake RADR. The device performs a full restart.

### Sleep vs Power Off

| Feature | Sleep Mode | Power Off |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| Power consumption | Very low | None |
| Wake time | ~2 seconds | ~5 seconds |
| Wake method | Button press | Power switch |
| State preserved | No | No |
| Use case | Between sessions | Storage |

<Tip>
Use sleep mode during sessions with breaks. Use the power switch for extended storage.
</Tip>

## Power Management Tips

### Maximizing Battery Life

1. **Use sleep mode** — When taking breaks, put RADR to sleep instead of leaving it idle
2. **Lower brightness** — The display backlight is a significant power consumer
3. **Disconnect when done** — Active Bluetooth connections use more power
4. **Power off for storage** — Use the physical switch for extended storage

### Monitoring Battery Health

- Check battery percentage periodically in the status bar
- Charge before sessions to avoid mid-session interruptions
- Don't let the battery fully deplete frequently

### Charging Best Practices

- Use quality USB-C cables
- Charge in moderate temperatures (avoid extreme heat/cold)
- Any standard USB charger works (5V)
- Fully charge before first use

## Specifications

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Operating Voltage | 3.3V (regulated) |
| Charging Voltage | 5V USB |
| Deep Sleep Current | < 100μA |
| Active Current | Varies by activity |

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Battery percentage seems inaccurate">
- The fuel gauge may need calibration after extended storage
- Fully charge, then fully discharge once to recalibrate
- Battery readings stabilize after a few charge cycles
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="RADR won't charge">
- Try a different USB-C cable
- Try a different USB power source
- Ensure the USB-C port is clean and undamaged
- Check that the charging LED illuminates when connected
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Battery drains quickly">
- Check if you're leaving RADR in active/idle state
- Use sleep mode when not actively controlling a device
- Active Bluetooth connections consume more power
- Older batteries may have reduced capacity
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Won't wake from sleep">
- Press and hold an under-screen button for 2-3 seconds
- Try the power switch if buttons don't respond
- Ensure the battery isn't completely depleted
