RADR provides visual, audio, and haptic feedback to communicate device state without requiring you to look at the screen.

## LED System

RADR has three RGB LEDs (WS2812B) positioned around the device:

| Position | Location | Primary Purpose |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| LED 0 | Left encoder | Speed mode indicator |
| LED 1 | Middle | Connection/play state |
| LED 2 | Right encoder | Active mode indicator |

### LED Colors and Meanings

#### System States

| State | LED | Color | HSV Value | Brightness |
|-------|-----|-------|-----------|------------|
| Searching/Scanning | All | Blue | 150 | 255 (pulsing) |
| Idle (Main Menu) | All | Soft White | 180 | 50 |
| Device Connected | Middle | White | — | 50 |
| Paused/Stopped | Middle | Red | — | 255 |

#### OSSM Control Modes

When controlling an OSSM, the encoder LEDs indicate the active mode:

| Mode | LED | Color | Description |
|------|-----|-------|-------------|
| Speed | Left | Purple | Always active (speed is always controlled by left encoder) |
| Depth | Right | Coral/Red | Right encoder is adjusting depth |
| Sensation | Right | Blue | Right encoder is adjusting sensation |
| Stroke | Right | Green | Right encoder is adjusting stroke |

### LED Behavior Patterns

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Solid | Static state (connected, paused, etc.) |
| Pulsing | Active scan or searching |
| Quick flash | Feedback for button press or mode change |

## Buzzer Patterns

RADR uses a piezoelectric buzzer (GPIO 2) to provide audio feedback for key events.

### Boot Sound

**Pattern:** 4-note ascending sequence

| Note | Frequency | Duration |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | 523 Hz (C5) | 100ms |
| 2 | 659 Hz (E5) | 100ms |
| 3 | 784 Hz (G5) | 100ms |
| 4 | 1047 Hz (C6) | 150ms |

Played when RADR powers on.

### Shutdown Sound

**Pattern:** 4-note descending sequence

| Note | Frequency | Duration |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | 1047 Hz (C6) | 100ms |
| 2 | 784 Hz (G5) | 100ms |
| 3 | 659 Hz (E5) | 100ms |
| 4 | 523 Hz (C5) | 150ms |

Played when entering sleep mode.

### Device Connected

**Pattern:** 3-note ascending sequence

| Note | Frequency | Duration |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | 1047 Hz (C6) | 80ms |
| 2 | 1319 Hz (E6) | 80ms |
| 3 | 1568 Hz (G6) | 120ms |

Played when successfully connecting to a device.

### Device Disconnected

**Pattern:** 3-note descending sequence

| Note | Frequency | Duration |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | 1568 Hz (G6) | 80ms |
| 2 | 1319 Hz (E6) | 80ms |
| 3 | 1047 Hz (C6) | 120ms |

Played when a device disconnects.

### Paused

**Pattern:** Double beep

| Note | Frequency | Duration |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | 800 Hz | 150ms |
| Gap | — | 100ms |
| 2 | 800 Hz | 150ms |

Played when pausing playback.

### Play/Resume

**Pattern:** Two-tone ascending

| Note | Frequency | Duration |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | 1200 Hz | 100ms |
| 2 | 1400 Hz | 100ms |

Played when resuming playback.

### Mario Coin (Easter Egg)

**Pattern:** Classic coin sound

| Note | Frequency | Duration |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | 2637 Hz (E7) | 80ms |
| 2 | 3136 Hz (G7) | 300ms |

Special feedback for certain interactions.

## Vibration Feedback

RADR includes a vibration motor (GPIO 47) for haptic feedback. Vibration patterns generally mirror buzzer patterns, providing tactile feedback that works without sound.

### Vibration Use Cases

| Event | Vibration |
|-------|-----------|
| Button press | Short pulse |
| Mode change | Quick vibration |
| Connection | Double vibration |
| Pause/Stop | Strong vibration |

### Vibration Pattern Timings

| Pattern | Description | Pulse Durations (ms) |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| Single Pulse | Quick tap feedback | 50 |
| Double Pulse | Confirmation feedback | 50, pause 200, 50 |
| Triple Pulse | Strong confirmation | 10, pause 50, 20, pause 50, 30 |
| Error Pulse | Long error indication | 500 |
| Shutdown | Descending pulses | 150, 100, 100, 100 |
| Device Connected | Ascending pulses | 100, 100, 150 |
| Device Disconnected | Descending pulses | 150, 100, 100 |
| Paused | Double pulse | 150, 150 |
| Play/Resume | Quick double pulse | 100, 100 |

<Info>
Vibration feedback helps you operate RADR by feel, especially useful in low-light or when the device is out of direct view.

## UI Color Scheme

RADR's display uses a consistent color scheme:

### Background Colors

| Element | Color Code | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Background | 0x10c5 | Dark gray (Gray 900) |
| Text Background | White | Primary text color |
| Secondary Text | 0xDEFB | Light gray |
| Disabled | 0x1082 | Very dark gray |

### OSSM Mode Colors

| Mode | Color Code | Color Name |
|------|------------|------------|
| Speed | 0x5013 | Royal Purple |
| Depth | 0xE186 | Warm Coral |
| Sensation | 0x3C9F | Ocean Blue |
| Stroke | 0x4E8A | Forest Green |

### State Colors

| State | Color |
|-------|-------|
| Active/Normal | White |
| Paused/Stopped | Red |
| Disabled | Dark Gray |
| Selected/Highlighted | Accent colors |

## Feedback Timing

| Event | Response Time |
|-------|---------------|
| Button press | < 10ms |
| Encoder change | < 10ms |
| Mode switch | < 50ms |
| LED color change | < 20ms |

## Tips for Using Feedback

<Tip>
Learn the buzzer sounds to operate RADR without looking. The connected sound (ascending) vs disconnected sound (descending) clearly indicates state.
</Tip>

<Tip>
The left LED (purple for speed) and right LED (mode color) tell you which parameter each encoder controls at a glance.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Red middle LED always means paused or stopped. White means active and ready.
