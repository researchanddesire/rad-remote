## Core Components

### Microcontroller

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| MCU | ESP32-S3 |
| Memory | Includes PSRAM |
| Wireless | WiFi + Bluetooth LE |
| Operating Voltage | 3.3V |

The ESP32-S3 provides:
- Dual-core Xtensa LX7 processor
- Integrated Bluetooth Low Energy for device communication
- Sufficient GPIO for all inputs, outputs, and peripherals
- Low-power sleep modes for battery conservation

### Power Management

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| USB-C Connector | 5V charging input |
| Charging IC | LiPo battery charging |
| MAX17048 | Fuel gauge (battery monitoring) |
| LDO/Regulator | 3.3V system power |

The power system supports:
- USB-C charging (5V input)
- Hardware charging LED indicator
- Precision battery percentage via I²C fuel gauge
- Deep sleep current < 100μA

### Display Interface

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Display Type | TFT LCD |
| Resolution | 320 x 240 pixels |
| Color Depth | 16-bit (RGB565) |
| Interface | SPI |
| Backlight | PWM-controlled |

### User Inputs

| Input | Type | GPIO |
|-------|------|------|
| Left Encoder | Rotary + Push | GPIO 10, 11 |
| Right Encoder | Rotary + Push | GPIO 42, 41 |
| Left Shoulder | Momentary switch | GPIO 48 |
| Right Shoulder | Momentary switch | GPIO 1 |
| Under-Screen Left | Momentary switch | GPIO 38 |
| Under-Screen Center | Momentary switch | GPIO 39 |
| Under-Screen Right | Momentary switch | GPIO 40 |

<Note>
GPIO assignments shown are for v0.4 boards with PSRAM. Earlier v1.x boards use different pins for the left encoder (GPIO 35, 36) and LEDs (GPIO 37).
</Note>

### Feedback Outputs

| Component | Type | GPIO |
|-----------|------|------|
| Status LEDs | WS2812B RGB (x3) | GPIO 12 |
| Buzzer | Piezoelectric | GPIO 2 |
| Vibration Motor | ERM motor | GPIO 47 |

### Expansion

| Connector | Interface | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| QWIIC | I²C | External sensors/peripherals |
| USB-C | USB 2.0 | Programming and charging |

## Schematic Sections

The schematic is organized into functional blocks:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Power | USB-C input, charging circuit, voltage regulation |
| MCU | ESP32-S3, crystal, reset, boot selection |
| Display | TFT LCD connector, backlight driver |
| Inputs | Rotary encoders, buttons, pull-up/pull-down resistors |
| Feedback | LED data line, buzzer driver, motor driver |
| Battery | MAX17048 fuel gauge, battery connector |
| Expansion | QWIIC connector, programming header |

## PCB Layout Considerations

### Component Placement

- **MCU** positioned centrally for balanced trace routing
- **USB-C** connector at board edge for accessibility
- **Display connector** oriented for ribbon cable routing to enclosure
- **Battery connector** positioned for internal battery placement
- **QWIIC connector** accessible for expansion modules

### Antenna Considerations

The ESP32-S3 uses an integrated PCB antenna or external antenna (version dependent). The antenna area should be kept clear of:
- Ground planes directly beneath
- Metal enclosure proximity
- High-frequency switching signals

<Warning>
Do not place components or route traces in the antenna keepout zone. This significantly degrades wireless performance.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Services like JLCPCB and PCBWay offer combined PCB fabrication and assembly. Upload the Gerbers and BOM for a turnkey solution.
</Tip>

### Critical Components

These components require careful attention during assembly:

| Component | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| ESP32-S3 Module | Check orientation, ensure all pads are soldered |
| USB-C Connector | Requires precise alignment, check for shorts |
| MAX17048 | Small QFN package, needs proper reflow |
| WS2812B LEDs | Heat-sensitive, observe reflow profile |

## Version History

| Version | Changes |
|---------|---------|
| v0.4 | Current release with ESP32-S3 |

<Note>
Version v0.4 uses the ESP32-S3 variant. The "S3" suffix in the BOM filename indicates this variant.
