## Open Source Hardware

RADR is genuinely open source hardware. The project is licensed under the **CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal (CERN-OHL-S v2)**, the same license used by the [OSSM](/ossm/guides/housekeeping/open-source/introduction).

<Info>
The strongly reciprocal nature of CERN-OHL-S v2 ensures that derivative works remain open source, protecting the community's collective efforts.
</Info>

## What This Means for You

When you contribute to the RADR GitHub repository, your contributions fall under the same CERN-OHL-S v2 license. You can find the complete license text in the [licence documentation](/radr/guides/housekeeping/open-source/licence).

### You Can

- **Use** RADR designs and software freely
- **Study** how RADR works and learn from its design
- **Modify** the hardware and software to suit your needs
- **Share** your modified versions with others
- **Build and sell** RADR units (with attribution and source sharing)

### You Must

- **Share alike** — If you distribute modifications, they must be under the same license
- **Provide source** — Make your modified designs available when distributing products
- **Retain notices** — Keep copyright and license notices in place

## Source Files

All RADR source files are available on GitHub:

## Community Contributions

Open source means contributions can come from anyone, anywhere. Before using or contributing to RADR:

- Review the [safety guidelines](/ossm/guides/housekeeping/safety) thoroughly
- Understand your personal risks and boundaries
- Familiarize yourself with the contribution process

## Why Open Source?

We believe in:

1. **Transparency** — You can verify exactly what your device does
2. **Repairability** — Full documentation means you can fix and maintain your device
3. **Customization** — Modify the design to suit your specific needs
4. **Community** — Build on the work of others and contribute back
5. **Longevity** — Open designs outlive any single company
