## Overview

RADR supports Research And Desire devices first, followed by popular third‑party toys via direct integrations and the Buttplug.io Bluetooth protocol. We continuously evaluate, implement, and validate support across 2025–2026.

### Status legend

- Supported: RADR can connect and control the device.
- Tested: Verified by R+D in-house for reliability with RADR.
- Vibration Only: Only the vibration motor is controllable; advanced features (heating, thrusting, suction, rotation, lighting) are not yet supported.
- Oscillation Only: Only oscillation/thrusting control is available; vibration features are not supported.
- Pending: Not yet implemented; on the roadmap.

<Tip>
For the smoothest setup, keep your device firmware up to date and follow the <a href="../getting-started/quick-start">Quick Start</a> to pair.
</Tip>

<Info>
Device support is continuously expanding. RADR uses a dynamic device registry that can be updated via firmware updates without changing the core application, allowing new devices to be added more frequently.
</Info>

<Warning>
Untested devices show a warning before first use. When connecting to an untested device for the first time, RADR displays a confirmation dialog. You must acknowledge you understand the risks before proceeding. Start at the lowest intensity and verify basic controls before a session.
</Warning>

## Verify your device works with RADR

<Steps>
<Step title="Charge and update">
Charge your RADR via USB‑C. If your OSSM or RADR needs an update, flash using the <a href="/ossm/guides/getting-started/web-flasher">Web Flasher</a>.

<Check>
Device powers on and shows the home screen.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Power on and make discoverable">
Turn on your target device and ensure Bluetooth is enabled or the device is in pairing/advertising mode (consult the device's manual if unsure).
</Step>

<Step title="Scan with RADR">
Follow the <a href="../getting-started/quick-start">Quick Start</a> to scan. RADR only lists supported devices; if yours appears, select to connect.

<Check>
You can start/stop and change intensity from RADR.

## Buttplug.io devices

Through our partnership with Buttplug.io, RADR supports Bluetooth devices that speak the Buttplug protocol. Check their public compatibility list for the most current coverage. Feature availability varies by model; in many cases RADR provides vibration control only.

### Lovense (tested)

| Device | Supported | Tested |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lovense Domi | Vibration Only | Yes |
| Lovense Hyphy | Vibration Only | Yes |
| Lovense Ferri | Vibration Only | Yes |

<Info>
Lovense Domi (and Domi 2) has direct integration—not via Buttplug.io—that includes battery level reading and power control commands. Other Lovense devices use the generic Buttplug.io implementation with vibration-only control.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="My device doesn't appear in the scan list">
- Ensure it's a supported model and is powered on/in pairing mode
- Move the device within 1–2 meters of RADR
- Power‑cycle both RADR and the device, then rescan
- Update firmware where applicable: <a href="/ossm/guides/getting-started/web-flasher">Flashing your OSSM</a>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Device connects but controls don't work">
- Many third‑party devices are "Vibration Only" on first release
- Try basic intensity up/down; advanced features may be pending
- Disconnect other apps that might have claimed the device over Bluetooth
