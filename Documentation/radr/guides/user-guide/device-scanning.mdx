This guide explains how RADR discovers nearby Bluetooth devices and establishes connections.

## Automatic Scanning

When you power on RADR, it automatically scans for nearby supported Bluetooth devices.

### Scan Behavior

- **Duration:** 5 seconds
- **LED Indicator:** Blue pulsing during scan
- **Status Message:** "Searching for nearby devices..."

During the scan:
1. RADR broadcasts as "OSSM-REMOTE" with high transmit power (9 dBm)
2. It searches for devices advertising supported service UUIDs
3. Discovered devices are added to the device list

## Manual Scanning

To start a manual scan:

1. From the main menu, select **Device Search**
2. RADR scans for 5 seconds
3. After scanning, the device list appears

<Tip>
Use manual scanning when you've powered on a new device after RADR's initial boot scan.
</Tip>

## Device List

After scanning, the device list shows all discovered devices:

- Devices are shown by their advertised Bluetooth name
- If a device has no name, it appears as "Unknown Device"
- The list is scrollable if multiple devices are found

### Navigating the Device List

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Right Encoder | Scroll through devices |
| Right Button | Connect to selected device |
| Left Button | Cancel and return to main menu |

## Connecting to a Device

When you select a device from the list, RADR initiates a connection:

### Connection Status Messages

You'll see these status messages in sequence:

1. **"Initializing connection..."** — Setting up the connection process
2. **"Checking existing connections..."** — Verifying no conflicts
3. **"Attempting fast reconnect..."** — Trying quick reconnection if previously paired
4. **"Creating new connection..."** — Establishing a new Bluetooth connection
5. **"Connecting to [address]..."** — Connecting to the specific device
6. **"Connected! Setting up device..."** — Connection established, configuring
7. **"Discovering device capabilities..."** — Reading device features
8. **"Device ready!"** — Connection complete, entering control mode

### Connection Parameters

RADR uses optimized connection parameters for responsive control:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Connection interval | 15ms |
| Latency | 0 |
| Timeout | 1500ms |
| Connect timeout | 5000ms |

## Connection Failures

If connection fails, you'll see:

- **"Connection failed, please try again."** — General connection failure
- **"Connection limit reached!"** — Too many active BLE connections
- **"Device service not found!"** — Device doesn't have expected services

### Troubleshooting Connection Issues

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Device doesn't appear in scan">
- Ensure the device is powered on and in pairing mode
- Move within 1–2 meters for initial pairing
- Close any phone apps that might be connected to the device
- Power-cycle both RADR and the target device
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Connection fails repeatedly">
- Ensure no other app or controller is connected
- Power-cycle the target device
- Move closer to reduce interference
- For OSSM: Ensure firmware is 2.0.0 or higher
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Connection drops frequently">
- Stay within Bluetooth range (typically 10 meters indoors)
- Reduce interference from WiFi routers and other Bluetooth devices
- Keep phone apps closed to prevent connection stealing
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## One Device at a Time

<Warning>
RADR can only connect to **one device at a time**. To switch to a different device, you must first disconnect from the current device.
</Warning>

To disconnect and switch devices:

1. From the control screen, press left button to access the menu (when paused)
2. Navigate back to the main menu
3. Start a new device search

## Device Registry

RADR uses a two-tier device registry to identify supported devices:

### Built-in Registry

- Hardcoded support for Research And Desire devices (OSSM)
- Always available and cannot be modified
- Provides full-featured control interfaces

### Dynamic Registry (registry.json)

- Stored in RADR's internal filesystem (LittleFS)
- Contains Buttplug.io device UUIDs and configurations
- **Can be updated via firmware updates without changing the core application**
- This allows faster device support additions

When scanning, RADR checks both registries to identify devices by their Bluetooth service UUIDs.

<Info>
The dynamic registry enables Research And Desire to add support for new devices more frequently, as it only requires updating a configuration file rather than the entire firmware.
</Info>

### Supported Device Types

| Device Type | Control Interface |
|-------------|-------------------|
| OSSM | Full control (Speed, Depth, Sensation, Stroke, Patterns) |
| Lovense | Vibration-only control (0–16 levels) |
| Buttplug.io devices | Varies by device capabilities |

## Reconnection Behavior

If RADR loses connection to a device:

1. RADR automatically attempts to reconnect within 2–5 seconds
2. For OSSM: The machine gradually ramps down for safety
3. If reconnection fails, return to the main menu and rescan

<Info>
RADR remembers recently connected devices and attempts fast reconnection when possible.
</Info>

## Tips

<Tip>
For reliable connections, ensure only RADR is attempting to connect to your device. Close phone apps and other controllers.
</Tip>

<Tip>
If a device appears as "Unknown Device," it's still safe to connect—the control interface will be determined by the device's capabilities.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Keep RADR firmware updated to ensure compatibility with the latest devices.
