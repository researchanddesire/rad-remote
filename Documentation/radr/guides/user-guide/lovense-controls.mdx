RADR supports Lovense Bluetooth devices with a simplified vibration-only control interface. This guide covers how to control Lovense devices.

<Note>
RADR provides **vibration-only** control for Lovense devices. Advanced features like heating, rotation, or device-specific patterns are not currently supported.
</Note>

## Supported Lovense Devices

RADR has been tested with the following Lovense devices:

| Device | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Lovense Domi | Tested |
| Lovense Hyphy | Tested |
| Lovense Ferri | Tested |

Many other Lovense devices are supported but untested. See [Device Support](../reference/device-support) for the complete list.

## Control Screen Overview

When connected to a Lovense device, the control screen is simpler than the OSSM interface:

- **Left Encoder Dial:** Vibration intensity control
- **Center Button:** STOP button
- **Display:** Shows vibration level and device status

## Vibration Control

The **left encoder** controls vibration intensity.

| Parameter | Range | Default |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Vibrate | 0–16 | 0 |

- Turn clockwise to increase intensity
- Turn counter-clockwise to decrease intensity
- Setting to 0 stops vibration

<Info>
Lovense devices use a 0–16 intensity scale, not percentage. Level 16 is maximum intensity.
</Info>

## Stop Button

The **middle button** acts as an immediate stop:

- Press to set vibration to 0
- The device stops vibrating immediately

Unlike the OSSM, there's no pause/resume state—simply increase the vibration level to restart.

<Info>
For reliability, RADR sends the stop command twice with a brief delay. This ensures the command is received even if the first transmission is lost due to Bluetooth interference.
</Info>

## Battery Level

For Lovense Domi (and Domi 2), RADR can query the device's battery level via its direct integration:

- Battery percentage is shown on screen
- Check battery status before sessions to avoid interruptions

<Note>
Battery level is available for Domi devices via direct Bluetooth integration. Other Lovense devices may or may not support battery level reporting depending on their Buttplug.io implementation.
</Note>

## Connecting to Lovense Devices

<Steps>
<Step title="Prepare your Lovense device">
Turn on your Lovense device. Ensure the Lovense app is **closed** on your phone—only one controller can connect at a time.
</Step>

<Step title="Scan with RADR">
Turn on RADR or select **Device Search** from the main menu. RADR scans for 5 seconds.
</Step>

<Step title="Select your device">
Your Lovense device appears in the device list. Select it with the right button to connect.
</Step>

<Step title="Start controlling">
Once connected, use the left encoder to control vibration intensity.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Close the Lovense phone app before connecting with RADR. Bluetooth devices can only have one active controller.
</Warning>

## Limitations vs Native App

RADR provides basic vibration control. The following features are **not** available:

| Feature | RADR | Lovense App |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Basic vibration | Yes | Yes |
| Vibration patterns | No | Yes |
| Remote partner control | No | Yes |
| Sound-reactive modes | No | Yes |
| Alarm features | No | Yes |
| Device settings | No | Yes |
| Firmware updates | No | Yes |

<Tip>
Use RADR when you want tactile, physical controls without a phone. Use the Lovense app for advanced features and remote play.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Lovense device doesn't appear in scan">
- Ensure the device is powered on (LED blinking)
- Close the Lovense phone app completely
- Move RADR within 1–2 meters of the device
- Power-cycle both devices and retry
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Device connects but doesn't vibrate">
- Ensure vibration level is above 0
- Check that the device has battery charge
- Some devices need a few seconds after connection to initialize
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Vibration is inconsistent">
- Reduce distance between RADR and the device
- Move away from WiFi routers and other Bluetooth devices
- Ensure no other apps are trying to connect
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tips

<Tip>
Start at a low intensity level (2–4) and gradually increase to find your preferred setting.
</Tip>

<Tip>
The encoder provides quick access to all 17 levels (0–16). You can rapidly scroll through intensities.
