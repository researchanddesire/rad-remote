### Default OSSM Settings

When you first connect to an OSSM, these initial defaults are used:

| Parameter | Default Value |
|-----------|--------------|
| Speed | 0% |
| Depth | 10% |
| Sensation | 50% |
| Stroke | 50% |
| Pattern | Simple Stroke |

<Note>
After a **Full Stop** (double-press middle button), different reset values are applied: Depth 0%, Stroke 10%, Sensation 50%. This is intentional for safety—the device starts in a minimal movement state.
</Note>
