### Device Search Screen

When you select **Device Search** from the main menu:

1. RADR scans for 5 seconds
2. Blue LEDs pulse during the scan
3. Status shows "Searching for nearby devices..."
4. After scanning, the device list appears

### Device List Screen

After scanning, you'll see a list of discovered devices:

- **Right Encoder** — Scroll through the device list
- **Right Button** — Connect to the selected device
- **Left Button** — Cancel and return to main menu

<Info>
Devices are shown by their advertised name. If a device has no name, it appears as "Unknown Device".
</Info>

### Device Connecting Screen

During connection, you'll see status messages:

1. "Initializing connection..."
2. "Creating new connection..."
3. "Connecting to [device address]..."
4. "Connected! Setting up device..."
5. "Discovering device capabilities..."
6. "Device ready!"

<Warning>
If connection fails, you'll see "Connection failed, please try again." Power-cycle both devices and retry.
</Warning>

### Device Control Screen

Once connected, you enter the device control screen. The layout varies by device type:

**For OSSM:**
- Tab interface at top showing Depth, Sensation, Stroke modes
- Left encoder dial for Speed
- Right encoder dial for the active mode
- Bottom buttons: Menu (disabled), Pause, Patterns

**For Lovense:**
- Single encoder dial for vibration intensity
- STOP button in the center

See [OSSM Controls](./ossm-controls) or [Lovense Controls](./lovense-controls) for device-specific details.

### Device Menu Screen

For devices that support patterns (like OSSM), pressing the right button opens the pattern menu:

- **Right Encoder** — Scroll through patterns
- **Right Button** — Select the highlighted pattern
- **Left Button** — Return to control screen without changing

### Device Stopped Screen

After a double-press stop, this confirmation screen appears:

The bumper buttons (top edge) switch between Depth, Sensation, and Stroke modes without looking at the screen. The active mode is shown in the tab interface.
