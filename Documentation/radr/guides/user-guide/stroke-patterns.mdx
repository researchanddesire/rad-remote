RADR provides access to the OSSM's built-in stroke patterns. Patterns are loaded directly from your OSSM when you connect, so the available patterns depend on your OSSM firmware version.

## Accessing Patterns

To access Pattern Mode:

1. Connect to your OSSM
2. From the control screen, press the **right button (Patterns)**
3. Use the **right encoder** to scroll through available patterns
4. Press the **right button** to select a pattern
5. Press the **left button** to cancel without changing

<Info>
Patterns are loaded from your OSSM when you connect. The pattern list may vary depending on your OSSM firmware version.
</Info>

## Controls in Pattern Mode

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Right Encoder | Scroll through patterns |
| Left Encoder | Adjust speed (still works) |
| Right Button | Select the highlighted pattern |
| Left Button | Cancel and return to control screen |
| Middle Button | Pause and return to control screen |

<Tip>
The speed control (left encoder) continues to work while in Pattern Mode, allowing you to adjust intensity while browsing patterns.
</Tip>

## Available Patterns

RADR displays all patterns available on your connected OSSM. For detailed information about each pattern—including how the sensation parameter affects behavior—see the OSSM StrokeEngine documentation:

## Tips

<Tip>
Patterns work in combination with your speed setting. A pattern at 20% speed feels very different from the same pattern at 80% speed. Experiment with different combinations.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Start with **Simple Stroke** to get comfortable with the controls, then experiment with other patterns.
</Tip>

<Tip>
New patterns may be added through OSSM firmware updates. Check for firmware updates to access the latest pattern libraries.
