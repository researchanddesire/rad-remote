This guide covers how to control the OSSM (Open Source Sex Machine) using your RADR wireless remote.

## Control Screen Overview

When connected to an OSSM, the control screen displays:

- **Top:** Three tabs showing Depth, Sensation, and Stroke modes
- **Top Bumpers:** `<<` and `>>` buttons for mode switching
- **Left Side:** Speed encoder dial with arc indicator
- **Right Side:** Mode encoder dial (Depth/Sensation/Stroke) with arc indicator
- **Center:** Linear rail graph showing stroke and depth visualization
- **Below Graph:** Current pattern name
- **Bottom:** Menu, Pause, and Patterns buttons

## Speed Control

The **left encoder** always controls speed, regardless of which mode is active.

| Parameter | Range | Default |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Speed | 0–100% | 0% |

- Turn clockwise to increase speed
- Turn counter-clockwise to decrease speed
- The encoder has acceleration: faster turns make bigger changes

<Info>
Speed must be above 0% for the OSSM to move. When paused, increase speed to resume automatically.
</Info>

## Adjustment Modes

The **right encoder** controls one of three parameters, depending on which mode is active. Use the shoulder bumpers to switch modes.

### Depth Mode

Controls how deep the penetration reaches.

| Parameter | Range | Default |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Depth | 0–100% | 10% |

- Higher values = deeper penetration
- The depth is visualized on the linear rail graph

### Sensation Mode

Controls the intensity or "feel" of the motion.

| Parameter | Range | Default |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Sensation | 0–100% | 50% |

- Lower values = gentler, smoother motion
- Higher values = more intense, aggressive motion

### Stroke Mode

Controls the length of each stroke.

| Parameter | Range | Default |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Stroke | 0–100% | 50% |

- Lower values = shorter strokes
- Higher values = longer strokes
- The stroke is visualized on the linear rail graph

## Switching Modes

You have two ways to switch between Depth, Sensation, and Stroke:

### Using Bumpers (Recommended)
- **Left Bumper (`<<`)** — Switch to the previous mode
- **Right Bumper (`>>`)** — Switch to the next mode

The mode order is: Depth → Sensation → Stroke → Depth...

### Visual Feedback
When you switch modes:
- The corresponding tab at the top becomes highlighted
- The right encoder LED color changes:
  - **Coral/Red** — Depth mode
  - **Blue** — Sensation mode
  - **Green** — Stroke mode
- The left encoder LED stays **purple** (always speed)

## Pause and Stop

The **middle button** controls pausing and stopping.

### Single Press: Pause

A single press pauses the OSSM:
- Speed is set to 0%
- The pattern name changes to "Paused" in red
- The middle LED turns red
- The Pause button changes to "STOP" (red)

<Info>
To resume from pause, simply increase the speed with the left encoder. The OSSM will resume automatically.
</Info>

### Safety Feature: Persistent Speed Monitoring

When you enter Pattern Mode or other menus, RADR continues to monitor the left encoder (speed) for safety. This means:

- You can still adjust speed while browsing patterns
- If you turn the speed to 0, the OSSM stops immediately
- This ensures you always have instant stop capability

<Tip>
Even while selecting patterns, the left encoder controls speed. This is a safety feature, not a bug.
</Tip>

### Double Press: Full Stop

A quick double press performs a full stop with reset:
- Speed is set to 0%
- Depth is reset to 0%
- Stroke is reset to 10%
- Sensation is reset to 50%
- The "Device Stopped" confirmation screen appears

<Warning>
Full stop resets your adjustment settings. If you want to pause without losing your settings, use a single press.
</Warning>

## Pattern Mode

Press the **right button (Patterns)** to enter Pattern Mode.

In Pattern Mode:
- The screen shows a list of available patterns
- Use the right encoder to scroll through patterns
- Press the right button to select a pattern
- Press the left button to cancel and return

See [Stroke Patterns](./stroke-patterns) for details on each pattern.

## Linear Rail Graph

The linear rail graph in the center of the screen provides a visual representation of the OSSM's motion:

- The graph shows the stroke range and depth position
- As you adjust Stroke and Depth, the visualization updates in real-time
- This helps you understand the physical motion without looking at the machine

## Menu Button

The **left button (Menu)** is reserved for future OSSM device settings.

<Note>
The Menu button is currently disabled and has no function. The button styling changes when paused (appearing enabled), but pressing it has no effect. Future firmware updates will enable device-specific settings through this button.
</Note>

## LED Indicators During Control

| LED | Color | Meaning |
|-----|-------|---------|
| Left (Speed) | Purple | Speed mode (always active) |
| Middle | White | Active and playing |
| Middle | Red | Paused or stopped |
| Right (Mode) | Coral/Red | Depth mode active |
| Right (Mode) | Blue | Sensation mode active |
| Right (Mode) | Green | Stroke mode active |

## Quick Reference

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Left Encoder | Adjust speed (0–100%) |
| Right Encoder | Adjust active mode (0–100%) |
| Left Bumper | Previous mode (Depth ← Sensation ← Stroke) |
| Right Bumper | Next mode (Depth → Sensation → Stroke) |
| Left Button | Menu (disabled) |
| Middle Button | Single: Pause / Double: Full Stop |
| Right Button | Open Pattern Mode |

## Tips

<Tip>
Start with low speed and gradually increase to find your preferred intensity.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Use the bumpers to switch modes by feel—you don't need to look at the screen.
</Tip>

<Tip>
If you accidentally perform a full stop, don't worry—just re-adjust your settings and increase speed to resume.
</Tip>
