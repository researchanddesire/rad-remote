<Accordion title="Video transcript">
Today I have the new Research and Desire wireless remote, also called the RADR. And I'm super excited to show you how it connects with both OSSM and also a wireless Bluetooth device like the Domi right here. In order to control the OSSM, you have to make sure that you have updated your firmware to the newest version. Once you've done that, just make sure that your machine is plugged in and turned on. And I'll show you how it connects really quickly. I'm turning on the power switch. And as you can see, it is automatically searching for the device and voila, it is connected. You don't have to do anything else.

I'll go over some of the specifics of the remote now. The left-hand knob always controls speed and the right-hand knob toggles and adjusts depth, sensation, and stroke. I'm going to turn up the speed a little bit here so you can see that's going. Right now I'm in Stroke; as I move the Stroke knob, you can see one of the rings go up and down, so you can always see where you're at in terms of how much stroke you have on.

The buttons: this button here is Pattern. If you click into it, you'll be able to take a look at all the different patterns and you can select one using the Pattern button again. This button here is stop and go—pause or play. There we go, it stopped the OSSM immediately; click it again and the device is stopped. Once it stops you can just turn up the speed again and it'll start working again. And that's it for controlling the OSSM.

I also want to show you how to control the Domi. I'm going to turn off the OSSM and unplug it. Now I've got my Domi; I'll turn it on and do the same thing as with the OSSM. I turn on the RADR and it automatically searches for the device. And look at that—it connects to my Domi. I can play with the knob, and there's that stop button as well. There you have it: the wireless RADR connecting to both the Domi and the OSSM.

RADR started as a wireless, user‑friendly controller for the OSSM (Open‑Source Sex Machine), created in partnership with The Kinkymakers. It has since evolved into a versatile wireless controller for a range of Bluetooth‑enabled devices using the Buttplug.io protocol.

This guide helps you pair your RADR with the OSSM and get playing in minutes. The same process applies to other supported devices like the Lovense Domi 2.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- RADR charged (USB‑C)
- Supported device powered on nearby (OSSM, Lovense Domi 2, etc.)

### Powering on

<Steps>
<Step title="Charge your RADR">
Connect RADR to a power source with a USB‑C cable and allow it to charge.

<Check>
RADR turns on and the battery icon appears on screen.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Turn on RADR">
Flip the power switch to the right (toward the USB‑C port).

<Info>
RADR automatically scans for nearby supported Bluetooth devices.
</Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Prepare your device">
- For OSSM: Power it on and let it finish homing.
- For other devices (e.g., Lovense Domi 2): Power on and ensure no phone app is connected.

<Warning>
Only one controller/app can be connected to a Bluetooth device at a time. Close vendor apps (e.g., Lovense) before pairing with RADR.
</Warning>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Pairing with the OSSM

<Steps>
<Step title="Update your OSSM firmware">
Ensure your OSSM is running firmware 2.0.0 or higher.

<Card title="Flashing your OSSM" icon="microchip" href="/ossm/guides/getting-started/web-flasher">
Follow our firmware update guide if you need to update your OSSM.
</Card>
</Step>

<Step title="Power on and home the OSSM">
Turn on your OSSM and allow it to complete its homing routine. Keep it powered on.
</Step>

<Step title="Scan for devices">
RADR automatically scans for nearby Bluetooth devices for 5 seconds when powered on. A blue LED pulses during the search.

<Info>
You can also start a manual scan from the main menu by selecting **Device Search**.
</Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Select your device">
After scanning, RADR displays a list of discovered devices. Use the right knob to scroll through the list, then press the right button to connect to your OSSM.

<Check>
Connection status messages appear: "Connecting...", "Connected! Setting up device...", and finally "Device ready!"
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Start playing">
The Play Controls screen appears once connected. The middle LED turns white to indicate an active connection.

<Check>
You can now control your OSSM using the knobs, bumpers, and buttons.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Play controls

When RADR is paired, you'll see the Play Controls screen.

<Frame>
<img src="../../_images/image (2).webp" alt="Play Controls screen with speed and adjustment indicators" />
</Frame>

| Control | Action |
|---|---|
| Left knob | Adjust speed (0–100%) |
| Right knob | Adjust the active mode (Depth, Sensation, or Stroke) |
| Left/Right bumper | Cycle through adjustment modes |
| Left button | Reserved for future device settings (currently disabled) |
| Middle button | **Single press:** Pause — sets speed to 0, displays red "Paused" text, middle LED turns red. **Double press:** Full Stop — resets Depth to 0%, Stroke to 10%, Sensation to 50% |
| Right button | Open Pattern Mode |

<Tip>
Use the bumpers to switch modes without looking down. The on‑screen tabs show which mode is active: Depth, Sensation, or Stroke.
</Tip>

<Info>
When paused, increase the speed with the left knob to resume playback automatically. The middle LED returns to white when active.
</Info>

## Pattern mode

<Frame>
<img src="../../_images/image (3).webp" alt="Pattern Mode screen with a library of motion patterns" />
</Frame>

Press the right button to enter Pattern Mode and choose from built‑in motion patterns.

| Control | Action |
|---|---|
| Left knob | Adjust speed |
| Right knob | Scroll through patterns |
| Left/Right bumper | No action |
| Left button | Exit to Play Controls without applying |
| Middle button | Pause and exit to Play Controls |
| Right button | Select the highlighted pattern |

<Tip>
New patterns are added over time. Check for firmware updates to access the latest libraries.
</Tip>

## Sleep mode

To conserve battery when not in use, RADR offers a deep sleep mode accessible from the main menu.

<Steps>
<Step title="Access the main menu">
From the Play Controls screen, press the left button to return to the main menu (when paused) or disconnect your device first.
</Step>

<Step title="Select Sleep">
Navigate to **Sleep** using the right knob and press the right button. RADR plays a shutdown sound, turns off the display, and enters deep sleep.
</Step>

<Step title="Wake up">
Press any of the three under-screen buttons to wake RADR. The device restarts and returns to the main menu.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Connection recovery

If RADR loses connection—due to distance, power loss, or Bluetooth interference—it automatically attempts to reconnect within 2–5 seconds.

<Warning>
If reconnection doesn't happen quickly, OSSM gradually ramps down and pauses for safety.
</Warning>

If reconnection fails, power‑cycle both the RADR and your device. They will pair automatically on restart.

## Power saving

To extend battery life, RADR automatically dims the screen after 30 seconds of inactivity. After 2 minutes without interaction, the screen enters a deeper power-saving mode, and after 10 minutes of inactivity, the screen turns off completely.

Any button press or encoder rotation will instantly restore the screen to full brightness.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="RADR doesn't find my device">
- Ensure the device is powered on and charged
- Move within 1–2 meters for initial pairing
- Close vendor phone apps (Lovense, etc.) so RADR can take the connection
- Power‑cycle RADR and the device, then retry
- For OSSM, confirm firmware ≥ 2.0.0
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="OSSM isn't moving after I press Pause/Stop">
- Increase speed with the left knob to resume from Pause
- If you double‑pressed Stop, defaults are restored—re‑set your mode and adjustments
- Verify the OSSM completed homing and is not physically obstructed
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Patterns don't start">
- Ensure speed is set above 0
- Select a pattern with the right button (Menu/OK)
- Exit Pattern Mode (left button) and re‑enter if the screen appears unresponsive
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Frequent disconnects">
- Reduce interference: move away from Wi‑Fi routers and metal surfaces
- Keep phone apps closed to prevent connection stealing
- Update firmware on both RADR and your device when updates are available
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Next steps

Once you've completed setup, you should have:

- A charged RADR paired to your device
- OSSM or another supported device on current firmware
- Wireless control without cables or legacy displays
