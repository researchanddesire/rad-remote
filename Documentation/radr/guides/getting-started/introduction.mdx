## What is RADR?

{/* TODO: */}
**RADR** (pronounced like "radar") is a user-friendly, everyday wireless controller for sex machines and Bluetooth toys. Originally designed to control the [Open Source Sex Machine (OSSM)](/ossm/guides/getting-started/introduction), RADR has evolved into a versatile controller supporting a wide range of Bluetooth-enabled devices through the [Buttplug.io](https://buttplug.io/) protocol.

## Design Philosophy

RADR was created with these principles in mind:

1. **Simplicity** — Control your devices without reaching for a phone or computer
2. **Reliability** — Direct Bluetooth connection without cloud dependencies
3. **Tactile Feedback** — Operate by feel with physical knobs and buttons
4. **Openness** — Community-driven development and full source availability
