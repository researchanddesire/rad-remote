<Accordion title="Video transcript">
Today I have the new Research and Desire wireless remote, also called the RADR. And I'm super excited to show you how it connects with both OSSM and also a wireless Bluetooth device like the Domi right here. In order to control the OSSM, you have to make sure that you have updated your firmware to the newest version. Once you've done that, just make sure that your machine is plugged in and turned on. And I'll show you how it connects really quickly. I'm turning on the power switch. And as you can see, it is automatically searching for the device and voila, it is connected. You don't have to do anything else. I'll go over some of the specifics of the remote now. So the left hand knob always is controlling the speed and the right hand knob will toggle back and forth depth, sensation, and stroke. So I'm just going to turn up the speed a little bit here so you can see that's going. And right now I'm currently in stroke. As I'm moving the stroke knob, you can see one of the rings is going up and down. So you can always kind of see where you're at in terms of how much stroke you have on. In terms of these buttons here, this button here is pattern. So if you click into it, you'll be able to take a look at all the different patterns. and you can select one using the pattern button again. This button here is stop and go, pause or play. So there we go, it stopped your OSSM immediately and then it says if you click it again, device is stopped. Once it stops you can just like turn up the speed again and it'll start working again. And that's it for controlling the OSSM. So I also wanted to show you how to control the Domi, so I'm just gonna turn this off and I'm gonna unplug my OSSM. Alright, so now I've got my Domi and I'm just gonna turn it on. So it's on now and I'm gonna just do the same thing like I did with the OSSM. I turn it on and it's gonna automatically search for the device. And look at that, it is connected to my Domi now. I can play with the knob. And there's that stop button as well. And there you have it, you have the new wireless remote radar connecting both to the Domi and to the OSSM.

The RADR was originally designed as a wireless, user-friendly controller for the OSSM (Open-Source Sex Machine), created in partnership with The Kinkymakers. It has since evolved into a versatile wireless controller for a range of Bluetooth-enabled devices using the ButtplugIO protocol.

This guide walks you through pairing your RADR with the OSSM and getting started immediately. The same process applies to other supported devices like the Lovense Domi 2.

### Pairing with the OSSM

<Steps>
<Step title="Update your OSSM firmware">
Ensure your OSSM is running firmware version 2.0.0 or higher.

<Card title="Flashing your OSSM" icon="microchip" href="/ossm/Software/getting-started/introduction">
Follow our firmware update guide if you need to update your OSSM.

</Step>

<Step title="Power on and home the OSSM">
Turn on your OSSM and allow it to complete its homing procedure. Keep the device powered on.
</Step>

<Step title="Automatic pairing">
With both devices powered on and nearby, they will automatically pair within seconds.

<Check>
When connected, your RADR displays the Play Controls screen.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Play controls

When your RADR and OSSM are paired, you'll see the Play Controls screen.

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Left Knob** | Adjust speed |
| **Right Knob** | Adjust current mode (Depth, Sensation, or Stroke) |
| **Left/Right Bumper** | Cycle through adjustment modes |
| **Left Button** | Open OSSM Device Settings (coming soon) |
| **Middle Button** | Single press: Pause session (increase speed to resume). Double press: Stop session and reset to defaults |
| **Right Button** | Open Pattern Mode |

## Pattern mode

</Frame>

Press the **Right Button** to enter Pattern Mode and choose from a library of built-in motion patterns.

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Left Knob** | Adjust speed |
| **Right Knob** | Scroll through patterns |
| **Left/Right Bumper** | No action |
| **Left Button** | Exit to Play Controls without applying |
| **Middle Button** | Pause session and exit to Play Controls |
| **Right Button** | Select highlighted pattern |

<Tip>
More patterns are being added regularly. Check for firmware updates to access new pattern libraries.
</Tip>

## Connection recovery

If your RADR loses connection during use—whether due to distance, power loss, or Bluetooth interference—it will automatically attempt to reconnect within 2–5 seconds.

<Warning>
As a safety precaution, if the connection isn't restored quickly, the OSSM will gradually reduce speed and pause the session.
</Warning>

If reconnection fails, power-cycle both the RADR and your device. They will pair automatically when restarted.

## Next steps

Once you've completed setup:

- Your RADR is charged and paired
- Your OSSM (or other supported device) is running the latest firmware
- You can control your device wirelessly without cables or legacy displays
