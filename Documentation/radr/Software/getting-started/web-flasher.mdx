## Manual Flashing

If the web flasher doesn't work for your setup, you can flash manually using PlatformIO:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/researchanddesire/radr-wireless-remote.git
cd radr-wireless-remote/Software

# Flash with PlatformIO
pio run --target upload
```

## OTA Updates

RADR also supports over-the-air (OTA) updates via WiFi:

1. Configure WiFi in RADR settings
2. Select "Update Device" from the settings menu
3. RADR will download and install updates automatically

<Info>
OTA updates are convenient but require WiFi configuration. The web flasher works without WiFi.
