## Controls & Buttons

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="One bumper button feels different or has no tactile feedback">
Each bumper button on the RADR has two microswitches wired in parallel for redundancy. If one bumper feels different from the other or has reduced/no tactile feedback, this could be caused by:

- **Assembly alignment** — Print inconsistencies or alignment during assembly can cause one microswitch to activate differently
- **Screw tension** — A slightly over-torqued screw can affect the bumper's tactile feel

**To troubleshoot:**

1. Locate the single screw on the rear of the remote, directly behind the affected bumper
2. Try loosening the screw slightly (quarter turn)
3. Test the bumper feel again

If both bumpers still function (the button registers on screen) but one has reduced tactile feedback, the remote is working as designed—some variation is normal.

<Warning>
If the button has absolutely no tactile feedback or doesn't register presses at all, the microswitch may be defective. Contact support for a replacement.

<Accordion title="What do the bumper buttons do?">
The left and right bumper buttons on the top edge of the RADR switch between control modes when connected to an OSSM:

| Button | Function |
|--------|----------|
| Left Bumper (`<<`) | Switch to previous mode |
| Right Bumper (`>>`) | Switch to next mode |

The modes cycle through: **Depth → Sensation → Stroke → Depth**

<Accordion title="Why won't RADR find my OSSM?">
If RADR can't find your OSSM during scanning:

1. **Check distance** — Move RADR closer to your OSSM (within 10 meters)
2. **Power cycle both devices** — Turn both off, wait 10 seconds, then power on
3. **Check OSSM firmware** — Ensure your OSSM is running compatible firmware
4. **Disable other Bluetooth connections** — Disconnect other devices that may be connected to your OSSM

## Battery & Charging

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="My RADR makes a rattling sound when shaken">
A slight rattling sound when shaking the device is normal. This is caused by the internal battery pressing against a small piece of foam inside the enclosure.

The rattling does not affect functionality — nothing is broken.

If the sound bothers you, you can open the back panel and add a slightly thicker piece of foam to dampen the rattling.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long does the battery last?">
RADR typically provides 4+ hours of active use on a full charge. Battery life varies based on screen brightness, vibration feedback usage, and connection activity.
