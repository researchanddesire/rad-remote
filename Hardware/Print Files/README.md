## Print Guidance

### Print Settings
These parts print nicely at 4 layer wall thickness and 0.12mm layer height for smooth curves. Using your slicer's auto layer height function will balance resolution and speed.
The top housing needs significant supports, and the 3mf file gives my recommended settings for Bambu printers.
If you are printing the wireless remote clip - I would recommend 6 walls and just make it extra solid.

### Multi Color
Many of these parts contain multiple bodies to allow multi color printing. This is optional and you can simply print all as the same color if you don't need to see the LEDs. 
There are clear section for
* Power indicator
* Button statuts indicators
* Knob backlight and status
