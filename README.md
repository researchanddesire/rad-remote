# RADR - OSSM Wireless Remote
**RADR** (pronounced like "radar") is a user friendly every day sex machine controller for the people. It's designed to simply and easily allow you to control many bluetooth sex toys, without reaching for your cellphone.

It was originally designed to control the [Open Source Sex Machine](https://app.gitbook.com/o/Ax9sUDBJtmMXSfWrJ0FX/s/D35AaMdwNptkfTvLMiH9/), but it can control much more!&#x20;

## Why we made it

We wanted an open source wireless remote that could control not just the ossm, but all our fun BLE devices!
