### **Summary**

**OSSM Remote** (pronounced like "awesome") is a user friendly every day sex machine controller for the people. It's designed to simply and easily allow you to control many bluetooth sex toys, without reaching for your cellphone.

It was originally designed to control the [Open Source Sex Machine](https://app.gitbook.com/o/Ax9sUDBJtmMXSfWrJ0FX/s/D35AaMdwNptkfTvLMiH9/), but it can control much more!&#x20;

#### **Primary** Design Goals

* Compact&#x20;
* Highly performant
* Moderate cost
* 3D printable
* Easily-sourced components
* Moddable

Note: This is a _work in progress_ and we have attempted to keep compatibility with the current BOM going forward, but it's not guaranteed.

#### Is it _actually_ Open Source?
